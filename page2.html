                        <p class="mbr-step-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">My teaching and learning philosophy is much the same as my philosophy in life – to pursue <strong>excellence</strong>. Excellence, in the context of teaching and learning, is a function of one's own competence, character and contribution. I firmly believe that I can only excel at teaching if I have the competence (i.e. a sound knowledge in the field of Economics and the concomitant industry experience to ground it), character (i.e. a sincere desire to help form inquisitive young minds) as well as the willingness to instil good values in my students within and outside the classroom context. Once I have shared these traits with my students, would I have made a contribution (a difference) to their lives.  I owe my constructivist approach to teaching and learning, in part, to Professor William (Bill) Yeaton, my instructor at the University of Michigan who presented a graduate-level course entitled “Design of Observational Studies for Behavioural Research”. He emphasised the fact that effective teaching is not about what we give or do to our students. It is about how we stand in relation to them and how they come to see themselves in relation to the subjects they study. 
<br>
<br>The question that constantly frames my philosophy of teaching is “Where do my students come from, what do they need to know to keep growing and how can I best support them in getting there?” The challenges I have encountered in being an effective teacher are getting to know each student in order to understand how tertiary-level education in the social sciences fit into their lives, figuring out how their values and beliefs either inhibit or enhance their growth, trying to constantly challenge them to do their best and to be confident, to stand strong with them when they get wobbly, to help them realise what it means to be economically literate, and in the end, to help them integrate their experiences into extraordinary capacities that will allow them to keep growing on their own.&nbsp;<br></p>

                        <p class="mbr-step-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Establishing a fair playing field:</strong> I go to great lengths to ensure that students who have never studied Economics at school level or whose mother-tongue is not English, are not disadvantaged. I therefore summarise and rewrite entire chapters of our prescribed text in plain English and post these handwritten lecture packs onto the institutional portal. Students are expected to download and read these notes before they attend lectures. This allows them to have a better understanding of what the outcomes and content of a chapter is before they start reading the text from the prescribed textbook. They do have to understand though: There is no easy way out – my lecture packs are not a substitute for reading the prescribed textbook. Evidence from student feedback seem to suggest that they appreciate this strategy. This could also be a contributing factor to my high throughput rates over the past three decades.
<br>
<br><strong>Lecturing pace:</strong> Feedback from students has been vital to my own personal growth since I began teaching three decades ago. I have learned from them, for example, that the pace at which I present my lectures is too fast. Do I refute this? No. I admit that I bring a lot of energy to my class. However, I am of the opinion that, if I cannot get excited about my subject, why should my students be excited about it? I acknowledge that, sometimes, I tend to get “too excited and carried away” when I teach, assuming that students are able to keep pace. Beside my illegible handwriting, this has been a constant thread in some of the negative feedback I have received over the past three decades. However, I do try to make amends by slowly repeating what I have just said, thereby enabling the student to confirm his understanding of what was just taught. 
<br>
<br><strong>Cognisance of differentials in learning abilities and prior knowledge: </strong>When planning a curriculum or interacting with students, I am always conscious of their different learning styles and rates, what prior knowledge they have and what they will need to learn in the future. In my coursework Masters module, for example, the most reliable way to assess students' prior knowledge is to assign a task (e.g. a performance-based prior knowledge assessment, such as a mini quiz) that gauges the student's relevant background knowledge. These assessments I use for diagnostic purposes only, and the results do not count towards the student's DP. These mini-quizzes allow me to get an overview of students' preparedness, identify areas of weakness, and adjust the pace of the course. &nbsp;<br></p>

                            As a gate keeper, I am responsible for setting standards of achievement and for evaluating the progress of my students against those standards. I insist upon excellence and therefore do not reward laziness or sloppy thinking. I do not grade on a curve, but try to apply an absolute scale, where the bar is set at a fixed height, not to be lowered. In assessing and critiquing essays and assignments, I go to great lengths to understand the student's point of view, however erroneous, before attempting to give them my own. When I assess, I choose a conceptual path that leads from the student's current understanding to a broader or more conventional one. The students in my classes know this and often ask me for help in their other subjects!<br>                         </p>

                            I love teaching and I love being a teacher. I do not teach subjects – I teach people. My goal is to teach the whole person, i.e. the cognitive, affective, and behavioural dimensions of the human being. I love developing mutually beneficial relationships with my students. However, I believe that it is a fundamental mistake to see students as customers or as clients because such a view incorrectly implies that the primary duties in the relationship are the teachers' duties to the students and virtually ignores the duties of students to their teachers, fellow students, and themselves.
