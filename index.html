                    Teaching, mentoring and student philosophy</h2>
                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7"><div><br></div><div><strong>1.1	Teaching and learning philosophy</strong></div><div><br></div><div>My teaching and learning philosophy is much the same as my philosophy in life – <strong>to pursue excellence</strong>.  Excellence, in the context of teaching and learning, is a function of one’s own competence, character and contribution.  In this regard, I firmly believe that I can only excel at teaching if I have the competence (i.e. a sound knowledge in the field of Economics and the concomitant industry experience to ground it), character (i.e. a sincere desire to help form inquisitive young minds) as well as the willingness to instil good values in my students within and outside the classroom context.  Once I have shared these traits with my students, would I have made a contribution (a difference) to their lives.  William Arthur Ward stated it eloquently: “<strong><em>The mediocre teacher tells. The good teacher explains. The superior teacher demonstrates. The great teacher inspires.</em></strong>”  I do not want to be a mediocre nor a good or a superior teacher.  I want to be the great teacher who excels at influencing mind sets.  Only when I am able to become that great teacher who inspires his students to gain wisdom to the threshold of their own mind, would I consider my academic life well-spent because then I would have positively influenced their future. Until such time, though, will it remain a matter of persevere, persevere, persevere!</div><div><br></div><div>Economics is often viewed as a boring dismal science that seems to emphasise the fact that, in the face of the never-ending universal problem of scarcity, rational decisions need to be taken under difficult circumstances to minimise increasing opportunity costs.  While the latter may be true, students at undergraduate level tend to think that there are a finite number of “right ways” to approach such dilemmas, often affiliating themselves with the most popular School of Thought (at the time) while ignoring others.  I try to bridge these cognitive barriers because a thorough understanding of Economics compels one to view economic problems and possible solutions as complex phenomena with many shades of grey that require complex judgment calls.  <strong>It is for this reason that my teaching approach is considered somewhat eclectic, resisting a neat philosophical classification.  Some people may say that I embrace the constructivist approach to teaching and learning, </strong>where concepts of active learning and collaboration are central to the philosophy of education, but I prefer to identify themes which have emerged from my teaching experience over the past two decades and leave it to others to decide whether these themes constitute any coherent pattern.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>People, by their very nature, are inquisitive.  The goal of teaching should be to encourage students to seek answers to questions or problems, as it is in this way that they advance.  The main theme of my teaching philosophy is therefore one of <strong>‘reasoned thought’.</strong>  I seek to develop my students’ higher-level reasoning skills by engaging them in discussions and encouraging them to participate in ‘role-play’ exercises in class.  These role-play exercises require students to place themselves in the shoes of the entity under investigation, constantly asking themselves how they would rationally behave or react (in terms of their respective economic objectives) and what consequences said decisions would have on those surrounding them.  Students are therefore actively stimulated and drawn into the lecture.  Students enjoy these role-play activities and it makes them excited about learning.  A pedagogical teaching philosophy such as mine causes my teaching style to be highly interactive (often exhausting) as I constantly engage my students in dialogue, and often put students into dialogue with each other.</div><div><br></div><div>Another important element of my teaching philosophy is <strong>encouraging reasoned written and oral work, especially in developing logical arguments.</strong>  A major part of my teaching time is devoted to making suggestions and prodding, as students can only learn to present their ideas more effectively if someone shows them how and why modifications could be made to their natural style of thinking so that their reasoning becomes clearer.  Even though all teachers should implement this strategy, it does become ‘tricky’ at times, especially in a classroom setting of 500+ first- and second-year students, where lecturing becomes inevitable.  This system does, however, work very well with my third-year students, my coursework Masters students, as well as the students I taught on the Accelerated Learnership Programme (ALP) and the Management Development Programme (MDP).  Whether in a classroom setup or in meeting groups outside the classroom context, my goal remains to encourage thinking in rational analytical ways that will enable the student to find solutions to problems in other, unfamiliar situations. I particularly encourage my students to think about trends, directions, linkages as well as inter-related and underlying mechanisms as opposed to rote memorization of facts.</div><div><br></div><div>I view myself primarily as a f<strong>acilitator of learning</strong>, as opposed to being this ‘expert’ who simply delivers information to students.  It is impossible for me to be all things to all students. It is healthy for my students to see that I do not have all the answers and that I, too, must deal with contradictions about teaching and life just as they will. To embrace these contradictions and gaps in knowledge creates the opportunity for new understandings and ways of looking at the world.  I strive to structure my teaching around my students’ needs, rather than the demands of a particular concept or text.  It is in this context that I try to create the following learning environment for my students:&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>(i)	A <strong>positive class atmosphere and an environment</strong> that is conducive to learning.  Students are called upon to discuss questions, but mistakes are treated as opportunities to explore misconceptions, not as a reflection of a student's ability;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><br><div>(ii)	The perception that my course is<strong> a window on the world</strong>. It is my responsibility to equip my students with the knowledge that almost any event can be linked to the field of Economics (e.g. problems with the ozone layer, poverty, crime, household size, benefits and pitfalls of cheating on your girlfriend, etc.).  Examples such as these are used to remind the student that Economics is merely the study of mankind in its ordinary business of life and that the events we are expected to describe and analyse are, at times, quite dramatic but nevertheless rational;</div><div><br></div><br><div>(iii)	<strong>Access to a caring individual</strong>. No, I do not know all their names, but when I am teaching to 700+ undergraduates, I ensure that I am available during my consultation hours, via email or via appointment.  All correspondence from my students are responded to, whether I am able to get round to doing it at midnight or at 6am.  The point is: <strong>Nothing</strong> is left unresolved in my Inbox;</div><div><br></div><br><div>(iv)	<strong>Empowerment</strong>. I believe that anyone can do well in Economics if they are willing to spend the time at it. Some students grasp quickly, while others need to spend more time on it. If I provide any value added, it is by encouraging all my students to be interested enough in the subject to invest more time; and lastly&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><br><div>(v)	<strong>Mutual respect with reciprocal responsibilities</strong>. Students work hard, earn their grades, and are entitled to their opinions. My task is to facilitate their learning process.  However, I also believe that my students have duties toward me, to their fellow students, and to themselves. I believe that these duties support me in fulfilling my duties to other students. Therefore, I believe that it is the students' responsibility to be supportive of the teacher and fellow students by being: (a) tolerant of different points of view; (b) prepared for class; (c) willing to work hard to complete course activities; (d) willing to bring their life experiences into the classroom to benefit other students and to enrich discussions; and (e) willing to apply what they learn in class to real-life situations.</div><div><br></div><div>Nelson Mandela University teachers (and all other teachers, for that matter) impart more by way of example than precept and our students are very perceptive in recognising when we do not practice what we preach. There are several <strong>values</strong> that I try to teach students, both by my words and my actions. Included among these are the following: the importance of organisation, preparation and homework; respect for other people and their views; ethical behaviour; the value of clear and effective communication in both written and oral form; the centrality of equality, to name but a few.</div><div><br></div><div>Personal contact with students is essential to my approach. Many students need encouragement to talk to their teachers about school work or personal matters, so I emphasise my availability for informal discussion and my willingness to help them sort out any problems they may experience. My experience as a teacher is greatly enriched by this contact with students. I am fortunate to teach at an institution where I can follow the progress of students throughout their academic program and sometimes beyond graduation.  As I gained experience and confidence as a teacher, I came to realise that <strong>teaching is my PRIMARY professional responsibility.</strong> I have, consequently, tweaked my teaching technique for the past two decades, ensuring that I become a SAQA-accredited assessor so that I am able to identify and nurture the raw talent that is available amongst our undergraduate students.  This approach seems to have contributed to an increase in the number of senior Economics students we have had over the past few years (Note: this accolade must be shared between ALL members within our Department).</div><div><br></div><div>A final theme in my teaching philosophy, which I need to emphasise, relates to <strong>teaching in an inclusive fashion</strong>.  The Nelson Mandela University is a remarkably diverse institution, catering for the higher education needs of students from diverse backgrounds.  In order to be a successful facilitator, I think that it is important for us to embrace, accommodate and plan for this diversity in our teaching methods and philosophies. This means who we teach to, what we teach, and how we teach must consider equity concerns, language barriers and the startlingly different socio-economic backgrounds which may have given rise to the disparity in knowledge-base.  Only by acknowledging these facts, will we, as teachers and facilitators, be in a position to appreciate and celebrate the diversity of our student body.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>1.2	Teaching experience and responsibilities</strong></div><div><br></div><div>I have faithfully and diligently served the Economics department for 25 years (5 years as sub-head at the 2nd Avenue campus), ensuring that high teaching and assessment standards are maintained throughout.  My pass rates (at 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th–year levels) have never been lower than 83%; I have never had any student complaint raised against me about my teaching style or subject knowledge; I have been privileged to teach at all year-levels, on different programmes (diploma, degree, graduate level) at the different campuses of the NMMU (Missionvale, Bird Street, 2nd Avenue, South) and have had flattering feedback from both students and peers during my tenure.</div><div><br></div><div>As a SAQA-accredited assessor (Assessment College of South Africa), am I also qualified to provide training to a host of companies via the Business School and I am also able to assess the credibility of some of the Economics modules they teach.  This I have been doing for over 6 years.</div></h3>
